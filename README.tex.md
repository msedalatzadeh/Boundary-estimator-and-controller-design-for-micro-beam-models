# Boundary Controller and Estimator Design for Micro Beam Models

Based on the strain gradient elasticity theory by Lam et al., a new flexible micro beam model can be derived by making Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions and by using Hamilton principle. Accordingly, the governing PDE of motion and corresponding boundary conditions (BSc) for a micro cantilever beam with uniform cross section $A$ and length $L$ become

where $x$ and $t$ denote the independent spatial and time variables, respectively; $\rho$ represents the beam density; $w$ indicates the lateral deflection; $f(x,t)$ denotes distributed external transverse force; $F$, $M^c$ and $M^{nc}$ are control inputs and refer to boundary force, moment and non-classical moment exerted at the tip of beam, respectively.  In addition,

where $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the beam cross-section; $\mu$ and $E$ are the shear and Youngâ€™s modulus, respectively; $\ell_0$,  $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ are additional material constants that appear in the constitutive relations between higher order stress tensors and strain tensors in strain gradient elasticity theory. By setting $\ell_0$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ to zero, the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam model can be obtained straightforwardly. 

### External Distributed Forces
A schematic of the cantilever beam used in M/NEMS devices is shown in the Fig. 1. The cantilever has length $L$, uniform cross section $A$, and width $b$; it is separated by a gap with length $g$ from the underneath substrate. The substrate exposes the beam to nonlinear distributed forces arising from electrical potential difference and intermolecular interactions between the beam and the underneath substrate.

The intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in micron and submicron scale are the van der Waals and the Casimir force, which have different range of application. The Casimir force is effective in the micro-scale ranges whereas the van der Waals force is effective in nano-scale ranges. To investigate a general case, we omit consideration of the transition regime and formulate the distributed external transverse forces more generally as follows:

in which the first right-hand side term gives the value of the electrostatic force with first order fringing field correction; the next one gives the value of the Casimir force; the last one is the usual expression for the van der Waals force. Furthermore, $\hbar = 1.055\times 10^{-43}Js$ is Plank constant divided by $2\pi$; $c=2.2998\times 10^8 m/s$ is speed of light; $\epsilon_0=8.854\times 10^{-12}C^2/Nm^2$ is the permittivity of vacuum;  $A$ is the Hamaker constant with values in the range of $[0.4,4]\times 10^{-19}J$ and $V$ denotes the electrical potential difference between the beam and the underneath plate.
