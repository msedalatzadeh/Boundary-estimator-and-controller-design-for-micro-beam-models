# Boundary Controller and Estimator Design for Micro Beam Models

Based on the strain gradient elasticity theory by Lam et al., a new flexible micro beam model can be derived by making Euler-Bernoulli beam assumptions and by using Hamilton principle. Accordingly, the governing PDE of motion and corresponding boundary conditions (BSc) for a micro cantilever beam with uniform cross section $A$ and length $L$ become

where $x$ and $t$ denote the independent spatial and time variables, respectively; $\rho$ represents the beam density; $w$ indicates the lateral deflection; $f(x,t)$ denotes distributed external transverse force; $F$, $M^c$ and $M^{nc}$ are control inputs and refer to boundary force, moment and non-classical moment exerted at the tip of beam, respectively.  In addition,

where $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the beam cross-section; $\mu$ and $E$ are the shear and Youngâ€™s modulus, respectively; $\ell_0$,  $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ are additional material constants that appear in the constitutive relations between higher order stress tensors and strain tensors in strain gradient elasticity theory. By setting $\ell_0$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_2$ to zero, the classical Euler-Bernoulli beam model can be obtained straightforwardly.
